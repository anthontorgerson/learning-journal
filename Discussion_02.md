## Choosing a Text Editor

When you first dig into learning web development, one of the first things you'll want to do is download a text editor. This will be essential since you will be writing a lot of code. There is a wide range of text editors out there that have different features when compared to each other, but in the end what mostly matters is what editor you prefer.

## What Does A Text Editor Do??

A text editor is software that you'll use to enter your coding for developing websites.
Some features that you can use in a text editor include:

* __Code completion__ - suggests code completion choices for quicker, accurate code completion.
* __Syntax highlighting__ - highlights & categorizes code in color for an easier view & helps find errors.
* __Applying themes__ - easily applies colors & sizes of background & text for aesthetic purposes & also to reduce eye strain.
* __Selecting extensions__ - plugins for your text editor that will in the long run make things much easier for your coding experience.

Sure, you could use preinstalled text software such as notepad to enter code and develop your websites, but you won't have the conveniences (as noted above) that coding text editors such as *Visual Studio Code* have to offer.


## The Command Line & Basic Navigation

A command line or terminal is a text based interface to the system where you can enter text commands and you will afterwards receive text feedback. The command line typically presents you with a prompt, majority of the time you will be entering commands. Here is an example of command line & navigating through folders:

1) yourname$ pwd
2) /mnt/c/Users/yourname
3) yourname$ cd Desktop
4) desktop$ mkdir NewFolder

*Line 1* shows that I entered the command "pwd".
*Line 2* gives feedback, showing the file path or directory that I'm in (which is what the command pwd does)
*Line 3* shows that I entered the command "cd Desktop", which brings our file path/directory to the desktop folder.
*Line 4* shows that we're in our desktop and I entered "mkdir NewFolder" which creates that titled folder on my desktop.

Some/more basic navigation commands include:
* __pwd__ - "_print working directory_". Where we are currently
* __ls__ - lists the content of the directory
* __cd__ - "_change directory_". Move to another directory.

## Things to remember:
* __Relative path__ - A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
* __Absolute path__ - A file or directory location relative to the root of the file system.


## About files

Everything is a file, this includes a text file, a directory file, your keyboard, your monitor, etc. A file extension defines what type the file is which is denoted at the end of the file name with 2-4 characters after a full stop or dot/period. The following are common extensions:

* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

Important things to remember about files:

* __file__ - obtains information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* __ls -a__ - lists the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* Everything is a file under linux, even directories.
* Linux is an extensionless system; files can have any extension they want or none at all.
* Linux is case sensitive; avoid typos!

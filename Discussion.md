## What is markdown???

Markdown is a computer language or coding, used to generate html files. With this, you can control how your text appears on a web page by adding syntax to text. It is used so that while you are editing the text of your file, you can still read the file with ease as you're entering the syntax. It is unlike MS Word or Google Docs, in the sense that this is not a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor where you drag & drop objects to it's desired place. This is because the syntax you type indicate where & how the words will look different. Examples of this syntax would include:

- `#` for a size 1 heading.
- `##` for size 2 heading.
- `*` or `_` before and after a word to make it *italic*.
- `**` or `__` before and after a word to make it **bold**.

Markdown is easy to learn and a great tool to use for creating websites, applications and more. A website that is convenient to use for applying markdown is Github, where you can create repositories to add markdown files, type out your syntax/text and preview or share your html file afterwards.
